Big Data
	- Batch-> SQL, Files, beams of pipelines! 

IoT devices, sensors, robots-> throwing huge chunks of data!
	-> FREQUENT
	-> diff types of data-> telemetry, remote, update firmware
	 		monitoring
	-> over a period of time-> S X t = VOLUME of data 

3 Vs of Big data:
	- Velocity
	- Variety
	- VOLUME

-> Pub/SUb -> publisher-subscriber architecture 
	-> Pub/Sub DOES NOT STORE 
		-> 7 days of saved storage not persistent!
		-> PERSISTENT STORAGE-> absent -> store in GCS instead!
		-> IT RETAINS the data for 7 days!!!

Routers-> 2 jobs: forwarding and DROPPING!
	-> ACL or ROUTING table! 
Pub/Sub is a router-> it will forward/ or drop
	-> Iot devices may not be available all the time
		(During night hours, when factory is off)
	-> data is temporary retained or saved so that other
	GCP services can query data at-will!

-> PUSH and PULL
